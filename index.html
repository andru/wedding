                <p>Please join us for a simple, earthy, and joyful ceremony with delicious wholesome vegan grub and an afternoon 
                    of sincere sillyness followed by live music, dancing, and debauchery from dusk to dawn
                    at our friends' spectacularly beautiful farm in North Cornwall (near Launceston).</p>
            
                <p>There's plenty of room for vans and camping, or there's accomodation in the area if camping's not your bag (we'd advise booking sooner rather than later though).</p>
                <p>The Ceremony will start at 2PM for those of you driving on the day. Campers (and helpers!) welcome from Friday afternoon.</p>

                <h2>On The Day...</h2>
                <p>The hand-tying ceremony starts at 2PM, followed by dinner. After we've eaten there'll be an open mic 
                    where you're invited to say a few words, share a story, read a poem or sing a song. If you don't want to
                get up infront of everyone, there will be a memory book out to leave your thoughts, doodles, photos and keepsakes.</p>
                <p>We'll have some evening nibbles out, and bands and DJs from about 8PM until late.</p>
                <p>Parking will be on a field.</p>
                <p>No dogs - sorry!</p>

                <h2 >What to wear...</h2>
                <p>Wear whatever makes you feel fancy. From black tie and tails to spandex and glitter</p>

                <p>Just make sure your footwear is field-ready, and bring a coat and a brolly...</p>

                <h2 >What to bring...</h2>
                <p>Other than your fine selves, there are a few things we need you to bring!</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A cup or mug for your drinks</li>
                    <li>Bring your own booze - we're putting on a margarita bar, but after that there's no bar and no shops to stock up!</li>
                    <li>Everything you need for your stay (<b>there are no shops nearby!</b>). There'll be dinner on Saturday, and breakfast on Sunday.</li>
                    <li><b>Farm-appropriate footwear</b></li>
                    <li>A brolly and a coat (just incase)</li>
                    <li>A song, poem, story, or wisdom to share at the open mic (if you want to!)</li>

                <p>If you're in a van or happy camping, join us in the camping field! There's running water and compost toilets, but bring everything else you need to camp.</p>
                <p>Otherwise, there's lots of accomodation nearby. We can recommend 
                    <a href="https://quirky-holidays-cornwall.co.uk" target="_blank">Spring Park</a> just round the corner, 
                    who have quirky shepherds huts and cabins, or <a href="https://honicombe.co.uk/" target="_blank">Honicombe Holiday Village</a> 
                    who are a bit further away but also have lots of cabins.</p>
